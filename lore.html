<h1 class="glitch">THE LEGEND OF S0ULSH4DES</h1>

<div class="section">
  <p>In 2017, a glitched game appeared. No title. No thumbnail. No creator. Players who entered were wiped clean. Avatars reset, GUIs gone. One name appeared in the logs:</p>
  <p><strong>s0ulsh4des</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>He isn't just a myth. He's a presence — white-skinned, half-hooded, with a shattered black cross wrapped around his arm. Shades locked. Voice silent. Fans controlled.</p>
  <p>Teleportation. Script destruction. Server corruption. Dark hearts forged from a corrupted SOTH sword pulse behind him.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Some say he lives in a base called <strong>/ShadeRoot</strong> — made of old admin panels and deleted data. Screens there show user logins, banned game titles, and crashing code.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>When he joins, the GUI fades. Music glitches. You don't play the game — it plays you.</p>
  <p><strong>THERES N0 H1DING FROM D1RKNESS.</strong></p>
